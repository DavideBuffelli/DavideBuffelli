## Hi there 👾

I am a Senior Deep Learning Researcher at MediaTek Research in London (UK). I have a broad interest in Deep Learning, with a current focus on foundation models for multimodal time-series, optimization, and representation learning for structured data.

I hold a Ph.D. in Information Engineering from the University of Padova, where I focused on Graph Neural Networks and Graph Representation Learning and I was supervised by Professor Fabio Vandin. During my PhD I have been a Research Scientist Intern at Meta AI (London) and at Samsung AI Research (Cambridge), and a visiting student in Professor Pietro Liò's group at the University of Cambridge, and in Dr. Bastian Rieck's group at Helmholtz Munich.
